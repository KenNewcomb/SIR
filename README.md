The SIR Model is a two-parameter [epidemiological model]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic_model") that computes the theoretical number of people infected with a contagious illness in a closed population over time[(1)]("http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SIRModel.html"). This python script numerically solves the differential equations for a given parameter set and initial conditions.
